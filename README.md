## Description

This is a React Native app that provides the posibility to create and store your Contacts on a Cloud Database using Amplify.

## Tools
In this project I have used a variety of tools as: 

- Expo to speedup the React Native development.
- Amplify AWS to create a GraphQL service with NoSQL database.
- @react-native-async-storage/async-storage to handle local storage.
- expo-router v2 to handle all related with navigation and routing.

## Components

- Stack to manage the navigation inside the app.
- FlatList to optimize the creation of multiple items.
- View, Text, Button as regular part of development on React Native.

## Testing

- jest is used to run the tests
- @testing-library/react-native to render react native components


## Folder Structure

- `amplify/` for all Amplify AWS related implementation
- `src/` contains all code related with api generated by Amplify AWS
- `app/` is the route expo-router use as main to build the expo app
- `components/` this folder contains all the reusable components and hooks
- `constants/` used to store contants that required to be reuse
